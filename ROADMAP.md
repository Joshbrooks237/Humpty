- Secure initial funding

**Milestones**: Development environment operational, core team assembled, initial funding secured

## 🚀 Phase 1: Simulation & Algorithm Development (Months 3-6)
- Validate core algorithms using synthetic and public data
- Develop harmonics inference models
- Establish baseline performance metrics

**Deliverables**: Functional signal processing pipeline, trained harmonics models, comprehensive test suite

## 🛠️ Phase 2: Benchtop Hardware Integration (Months 7-10)
- Integrate algorithms with physical hardware
- Develop wearable form factor
- Validate end-to-end system performance

**Deliverables**: Functional wearable EEG headset prototype, real-time processing software

## 🔬 Phase 3: Laboratory Validation (Months 11-16)
- Validate system against established neuroscience
- Test harmonics hypothesis with ground truth data
- Establish clinical correlations

**Deliverables**: Neuroscience validation report, clinical correlation analysis

## 🏥 Phase 4: Clinical Pilot Studies (Months 17-22)
