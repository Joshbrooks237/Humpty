# Neuroscience Background

## 🧠 Brain Signal Generation
EEG measures synchronized activity of thousands of pyramidal neurons oriented perpendicular to the cortical surface.

**Established EEG Capabilities**:
- Cortical rhythm analysis (delta through gamma)
- Temporal precision (~1 ms)
- Event-related potential detection
- Clinical applications: epilepsy, sleep, basic neurofeedback

**Novel Harmonics Hypothesis**:
- Deep brain activity manifests as subtle cortical modulations
- Cross-frequency coupling as indirect deep structure markers
- Hippocampus: theta-gamma coupling
- Amygdala: beta-gamma bursts
- Thalamus: alpha spindle patterns

**Challenges**:
- Spatial resolution (~1-2 cm surface blurring)
- Inverse problem limitations
- Signal-to-noise ratio constraints

## 🏥 Clinical Applications
- **PTSD**: Hyperarousal pattern mapping
- **CTE**: Longitudinal functional change tracking
- **Cognitive Enhancement**: Real-time performance monitoring

Grounded in established neuroscience while pushing boundaries of current understanding.
